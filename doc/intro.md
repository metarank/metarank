# What is Metarank?

[Metarank](https://metarank.ai) is an open-source ranking service. It can help you to build a personalized semantic/neural search and recommendations. 

If you just want to get started, try:
* the [quickstart](https://docs.metarank.ai/introduction/quickstart) tutorial of implementing Learning-to-Rank on top of your search engine.
* a [guide on using cross-encoder LLM for search reranking](guide/search/cross-encoders.md) of building an LLM-based neural search.
* a [Collaborative Filtering recommendations guide](TODO) to create a "you may also like" widget as seen on many e-commerce stores.

## Why Metarank?

With Metarank, you can make your existing search and recommendations **smarter**:
* Integrate customer signals like clicks and purchases into the ranking - and optimize for maximal CTR!
* Track [visitor profile](https://docs.metarank.ai/reference/overview/feature-extractors/user-session) and make search results adapt to user actions with real-time personalization.
* Use [LLMs in bi- and cross-encoder mode](https://docs.metarank.ai/reference/overview/feature-extractors/text) to make your search understand the true meaning of search queries.

Metarank is **fast**:
* optimized for reranking latency, it can handle even large result sets within 10-20ms. See [benchmarks](https://docs.metarank.ai/introduction/performance).
* as a stateless cloud-native service (with state managed by Redis), it can scale horizontally and process thousands of RPS. See [Kubernetes deployment guide](https://docs.metarank.ai/reference/deployment-overview/kubernetes) for details.

Save your **development time**:
* Metarank can compute dozens of typical ranking signals out of the box: CTR, referer, User-Agent, time, etc - you don't need to write custom ad-hoc code for most common ranking factors. See [the full list of supported ranking signals](https://docs.metarank.ai/reference/overview/feature-extractors) in our docs.
* There are integrations with many possible streaming processing systems to ingest visitor signals: See [data sources](https://docs.metarank.ai/reference/overview/data-sources) for details.

## What can you build with Metarank?

Metarank helps you build advanced ranking systems for search and recommendations:
* Semantic search: use state-of-the-art LLMs to make your Elasticsearch/OpenSearch understand the meaning of your queries
* Recommendations: traditional collaborative-filtering and new-age semantic content recommendations.
* Learning-to-Rank: optimize your existing search

## Demo

You can play with Metarank demo on [demo.metarank.ai](https://demo.metarank.ai):

![Demo](./img/demo.gif)

The demo itself and [the data used](https://github.com/metarank/msrd) are open-source and you can grab a copy of training events and config file [in the github repo](https://github.com/metarank/metarank/tree/master/src/test/resources/ranklens).

## Metarank in One Minute

Let us show how you can start personalizing content with LambdaMART-based reranking in just under a minute:

1. Prepare the data: we will get the dataset and config file from the [demo.metarank.ai](https://demo.metarank.ai)
2. Start Metarank in a standalone mode: it will import the data, train the ML model and start the API.
3. Send a couple of requests to the API.

### Step 1: Prepare data

We will use the [ranklens dataset](https://github.com/metarank/ranklens), which is used in our [Demo](https://demo.metarank.ai), so just download the data file

```bash
curl -O -L https://github.com/metarank/metarank/raw/master/src/test/resources/ranklens/events/events.jsonl.gz
```

### Step 2: Prepare configuration file

We will again use the configuration file from our [Demo](https://demo.metarank.ai). It utilizes in-memory store, so no other dependencies are needed.

```bash
curl -O -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metarank/metarank/master/src/test/resources/ranklens/config.yml
```

### Step 3: Start Metarank!

With the final step we will use Metarankâ€™s `standalone` mode that combines training and running the API into one command:

```bash
docker run -i -t -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd):/opt/metarank metarank/metarank:latest standalone --config /opt/metarank/config.yml --data /opt/metarank/events.jsonl.gz
```

You will see some useful output while Metarank is starting and grinding through the data. Once this is done, you can send requests to `localhost:8080` to get personalized results.

Here we will interact with several movies by clicking on one of them and observing the results. 

> First, let's see the initial output provided by Metarank without before we interact with it

```bash
# get initial ranking for some items

> Now, let's intereact with the items `93363`

```bash

```

> Now, Metarank will personalize the items, the order of the items in the response will be different

```bash
# personalize the same list of items
# they will be returned in a different order by Metarank
curl http://localhost:8080/rank/xgboost \
 -d '{
