## What is *personalization*?

Personalization is showing the *same* items but in *different order* for *different users*.

The order of posts in FB, photos in Instagram, products in Amazon, and search results in Google is *personalized for each visitor*, as it directly affects user engagement: click rate and conversion. We've done **50+ a/b tests** in different ecommerce verticals to confirm it.

If you have items that are presented to a user in a specific order, you can personalize this order to improve your product's KPIs.

## Why Metarank?

Metarank can run on-premises or in the cloud, making it easy to get state-of-the-art ML technologies by teams having little to no ML experience. 

Building an in-house personalization solution can take around 6 months by an experienced team, and only large companies can afford it.

With Metarank, you can get up and running with personalization in *days instead of months* and be in control of **data privacy**, **optimization goals** and how Metarank is integrated into the infrastructure with **minimal vendor-lock**.

## Demo 

We have a built a [Demo](https://demo.metarank.ai) which showcases how you can use [Metarank](https://metarank.ai) in the wild. 

The [Demo](https://demo.metarank.ai) utilizes [Ranklens](https://github.com/metarank/ranklens) dataset that we have built 
using [Toloka](https://toloka.ai/) service to gather user interactions. 

Application code can be found [here](https://github.com/metarank/demo) and you can see how easy it is to query
[Metarank](https://metarank.ai) installation to get real-time personalization. 

Check out the step-by-step **[Tutorial](doc/tutorial_ranklens.md)** of running Metarank Demo locally.
