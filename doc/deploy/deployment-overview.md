# Deployment

- [Standalone deployment](standalone.md): run it as a simple JVM application, great for local testing runs and baremetal installs.
- [Docker](docker.md): run as a docker container
- [Kubernetes](kubernetes.md): production-ready deployment in Kubernetes

# Monitoring

- [Prometheus metrics](prometheus.md): export a prometheus-compatible set of JVM and application metrics.
